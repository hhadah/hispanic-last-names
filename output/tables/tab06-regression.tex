\item[1] \footnotesize{This table includes the estimation results of equation (\ref{eq:iden}).}
\item[2] \footnotesize{HW is an indicator variable that is equal to 1 if a person is the child of a Hispanic-father and White-mother, and Hispanic is an indicator variable that is equal to one if a person self-identifies as Hispanic.}
\item[3] \footnotesize{The sample is restricted to men working full-time full-year and are waged and salaried workers.}
\item[4] \footnotesize{Column one has the regression results when controlling for hours worked, age, and fixed effects. Column two has the results after controlling for education.}
