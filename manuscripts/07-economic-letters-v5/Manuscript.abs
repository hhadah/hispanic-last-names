Do individuals with Hispanic names face labor market discrimination? This study analyzes the impact of Hispanic-sounding surnames on wages among inter-ethnic children with one White and one Hispanic parent. I find that individuals with Hispanic surnames receive less education, more likely to be unemployed, and often earn less, with a notable wage gap favoring those with native-sounding surnames. People born to Hispanic fathers and White mothers receive 0.3 years of education less than those born to White fathers and Hispanic mothers. Males born to Hispanic fathers and White mothers are 1 percentage point more likely to be unemployed, and they also earn 5 percentage points less than those born to White fathers and Hispanic mothers. The earnings gap is largely due to educational differences.
