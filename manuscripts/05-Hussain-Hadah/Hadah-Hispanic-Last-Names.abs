Do individuals with Hispanic names face labor market discrimination? This study analyzes the impact of Hispanic-sounding surnames on wages among inter-ethnic children with one White and one Hispanic parent. I find that individuals with Hispanic surnames often earn less, with a notable wage gap favoring those with White surnames. People born to Hispanic fathers and White mothers receive 0.3 years of education less than those born to White fathers and Hispanic mothers. Males born to Hispanic fathers and White mothers earn 5 percentage points less than those born to White fathers and Hispanic mothers, largely due to educational differences. Additionally, men with Spanish-sounding last names who identify as Hispanic earn significantly less, again due to educational disparities.
